Nuclex.Support.Native
=====================

This library contains general-purpose supporting code with a focus
on small but well-organized pieces you can use throughout other projects
to make you life easier.

There are unit tests for the whole library, so everything is verifiably
working on all platforms tested (Linux, Windows, Raspberry).

* Locale-independent string/number conversion
* Conversion between std::string and std::wstring
* Case-insensitive UTF-8 string comparison
* UTF-8 wildcard matching

* Fast and lightweight signal/slot implementation
* Lean dependency injector with automatic constructor detection

* Supports Windows, Linux and ARM Linux (Raspberry PI)
* Compiles cleanly at maximum warning levels with MSVC, GCC and clang
* Everything is unit-tested


lexical_cast & lexical_append
-----------------------------

This is almost identical to the `lexical_cast` function found in Boost,
but it avoids the heavyweight iostreams library. By shipping its own
number/string conversion code, locale issues are avoided and you'll get
the same results independent of the system's locale.

This is very nice if you have to serialize data (i.e. JSON or XML) on
multiple platforms because the data is binary-reproducible.

```cpp
std::string myString = lexical_cast<std::string>(12.34f);
float myFloat = lexical_cast<float>(u8"43.21");
```

Or to append text to an `std::string` or buffer without intermediate copies:

```cpp
std::string scoreText = u8"Current score: ";
lexical_append(scoreText, 110025);
```

StringConverter & StringMatcher
-------------------------------

Useful helper methods for strings, such as conversion between UTF-8,
UTF-16 and UTF-32. Can also convert between "wide char" strings and UTF-8.
Wide chars are the bad side of unicode that Windows programmers have to deal
with, often coming from `TEXT()` macros that expand to `L"my string"`,
thus creating UTF-16 on Windows and UTF-32 on Linux.

```cpp
// This works on any platform, whether wchar_t is UTF-16 or UTF-32
std::string utf8 = StringConverter::Utf8FromWide(L"Hello World");

// If you need to read or write UTF-16 to communicate with Windows systems
std::u16string alwaysUtf16 = StringConverter::Utf16FromUtf8(u8"Hello World");
```

Also performs case-insensitive UTF-8 string comparison (done right by using
the case folding table released by the unicode consortium):

```cpp
// Comparison uses current case folding table and should be as safe as ICU.
bool areEqual = StringMatcher::AreEqual(u8"Hello", u8"hello");
````

And UTF-8 wildcard matching as known from various shells:

```cpp
bool returnsTrue = StringMatcher::FitsWilcard(
  u8"Cupboard-Albedo.png", u8"*-Albedo.png"
);
bool alsoReturnsTrue = StringMatcher::FitsWildcarD(
  u8"食器棚〜Albedo.png", u8"*〜Albedo.png"
);
```

Uses [UTF8-CPP](https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp) and some custom code.

Events (Signal/Slot system)
---------------------------

A robust, lean and fast signal/slot system. It's extremely fast (no library
I tested it against could keep up) and yet offers a decent set of functionality
including:

  * Collecting return values from callbacks
  * Doing so into an existing container without allocating memory
  * Callbacks unsubscribing themselves inside the notification call
  * Callbacks subscribing additional callbacks inside the notification call
  * Unsubscribing with just the method pointer (no connection object to keep)

The basic syntax is this:

```cpp
void test() {
  std::cout << "You called?" << std::endl;
}
int main() {
  Nuclex::Support::Events::Event<void()> event;
  event.Subscribe<test>();
  event();
}
```

You can find some benchmarks on my blog:
[Nuclex Signal/Slot Library: Benchmarks](http://blog.nuclex-games.com/2019/10/nuclex-signal-slot-benchmarks)

I'm naming these *events* rather than *signals* because the term *signal*
is taken by `std::signal` for something entirely different and and least
in Microsoft land, the term *event* is pretty common for this concept.


Dependency Injector
-------------------

A dependency injector that is non-intrusive, easy to use and automatically
detects your constructor parameters. With this, systems no longer need to
rely on anti-patterns like singletons and remain unit-testable.

  * Easy, fluent syntax inspired by Ninject for .NET
  * All standard C++, no macros, no preprocessor, no code generator, no XML
  * Service implementation type is only needed at site of service registration
  * Recursive dependency resolution

Here's an example that shows how it works:

```cpp
class CalculatorService {
  public: virtual int Add(int first, int second) = 0;
  public: virtual int Multiply(int first, int second) = 0;
};

class BrokenCalculator : public virtual CalculatorService {
  public: int Add(int first, int second) override { return first + second + 1; }
  public: int Multiply(int first, int second) override { return first + first * second; };
};

class CalculatorUser {
  public: CalculatorUser(const std::shared_ptr<CalculatorService> &calculator) :
    calculator(calculator) {}

  public: int CalculateSomething() {
    return this->calculator->Add(1, 2) + this->calculator->Multiply(2, 2);
  }

  private: std::shared_ptr<CalculatorService> calculator;
};

int main() {
  Nuclex::Support::Services::LazyServiceInjector serviceInjector;

  // Yep, it detects the constructor arguments, you can add or remove them :)
  // Yep, it's non-intrusive, standard C++ and statically compiled :)
  serviceInjector.Bind<CalculatorService>().To<BrokenCalculator>();
  serviceInjector.Bind<CalculatorUser>().ToSelf();

  std::shared_ptr<CalculatorUser> user = serviceInjector.Get<CalculatorUser>();
  assert(!!user);

  int result = user->CalculateSomething();
}
```

Process
-------

This class makes it easy to spawn child process and to capture the output they
send to stdout and stderr.

Creating child processes correctly is a rather complicated task that differs
a lot between Windows and Linux. This wrapper provides a sane, portable way to
launch, observe, wait on or kill child processes. It can be used for launchers,
auto-updaters or if you want to run a command-line application such as `ffmpeg`
or your C++ compiler:

```cpp
void handleFfmpegStdOut(const char *characters, std::size_t characterCount) {
  // Parse progress, log or just print it
}


int main() {
  using Nuclex::Support::Threading::Process;

  // Finds ffmpeg in 1) same directory as executable or 2) PATH environment
  Process encoder(u8"ffmpeg");
  {
    encoder.SetWorkingDirectory(u8"~/video-encodes");
    encoder.StdOut.Subscribe<&handleFfmpegStdOut>();

    encoder.Start(
      { u8"-i myvideo.avi", u8"-vcodec v210", u8"-an", u8"-y", u8"myvideo-v210.avi" }
    );
    bool hasExited = encoder.Wait(std::chrono::milliseconds(60000));

    // Use encoder.Write() to send something to the process' stdin
    // Use encoder.Kill() to as for termination and/or murder the process
  }
  int exitCode = encoder.Join();

  return exitCode;
}
```


Variant
-------

A variant is a variable that can store any type of value. It's essentially
what variables in dynamically typed languages are made of.

This implementation differs from `std::variant` of C++ 17 (which lets you
choose which types it can store). The `Nuclex::Support::Variant` can store
all primitive C++ types, strings and objects (within `Nuclex::Support::Any`)
and provides reasonable conversion between all of these.


Containers
----------

`Nuclex::Support` offers a few interfaces in case you want to expose lists,
sets and key/value pairs in a public API.

There are also a few specialty collections, such as a `RingBuffer` class optimized
for batch-processing and an alternative streaming buffer under the name
`ShiftBuffer` which offers better performance if your use case typically empties
(or mostly empties) the container when taking data out of it.

Shift buffers keep all data linear (no wrap-around) and wait for an opportunity
to cheaply empty the buffer (i.e. when none or only a few bytes remain in it).
When reading from the buffer, you can obtain a pointer into the buffer's memory,
thus handling the data without an unnecessary `memcpy()` / `std::copy_n()` call.
