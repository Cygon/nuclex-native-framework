  /// <summary>Helper methods for dealing with unicode and its different encodings</summary>
  /// <remarks>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Short overview of unicode: the &quot;unicode consortium&quot; has taken symbols from
  ///     all languages of the world and put them into a giant table. Said table is defined
  ///     with finite room for about 1,1 million symbols, but only some 140,000 symbols have
  ///     been filled so far. Nominally, the table is divided into 17 &quot;planes&quot; of
  ///     65,536 characters each, separating latin-based languages from asian ones and from
  ///     funny poop symbols but that's only important for font designers.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     An index in the unicode table is called a &quot;code point&quot;. To store text using
  ///     unicode, each code point has to be stored. The easiest way to do that would be to just
  ///     save a stream of 32 bit integers indicating code points. And that's what UTF-32 is.
  ///     While simple to deal with, its downsides are wasted space and endian issues.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     That's why UTF-8 became the global standard. It is a variable-length encoding where
  ///     the upper bits of the leading byte indicate the number of bytes that form one
  ///     code point. ASCII code points use only one UTF-8 byte (in fact, they map 1:1),
  ///     other latin letters and most asian ones use two bytes and only rarely does
  ///     a code point require 3 or 4 bytes in UTF-8.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     UTF-16 combines the worst of both, endian issues and wasted space. So naturally
  ///     Microsoft used it for unicode in Windows. A code point is represented by one or two
  ///     16 bit integers, again using the leading integer's high bits to indicate whether
  ///     the code point is complete or formed together with the 16 bit integer that follows.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Now one last confusing thing: where I write that UTF-8 encodes unicode code points
  ///     as 1-4 bytes, UTF-16 as one or two 16 bit integers and UTF-32 as a 32 bit integer,
  ///     the correct term to use would be &quot;characters&quot;. That's why in C++ the new
  ///     data types are <code>char8_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code>.
  ///     So &quot;character&quot; has been defined to mean &quot;encoding unit&quot; and is
  ///     not always enough to represent a full letter (aka code point).
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     A series of characters encoding a unicode code point is called a sequence.
