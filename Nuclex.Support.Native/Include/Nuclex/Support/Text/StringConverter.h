  ///   <para>
  ///     On Windows, 8 bit char strings are usually assumed to be ANSI (that is,
  ///     the 127 standard ASCII characters for the values 1-127 and a set of special
  ///     characters that is defined by the &quot;code page&quot; in the remaining values
  ///     from 128 to 255. Showing strings with the wrong code page displays the wrong
  ///     special characters (but ASCII characters remain intact).
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     On Windows, wchar_t is 16 bits wide and unicode generally means UTF-16,
  ///     so &quot;wide strings&quot; (strings holding wchar_ts) are UTF-16 strings.
  ///     Microsoft's unicode APIs and UI tooling uses this for all i18n support.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     In the rest of the computing world, the preferred format for unicode is UTF-8.
  ///     It's shorter and survives transmission through non-UTF-8 APIs.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     The fun begins with wchar_t. It's 32 bits wide on most non-Microsoft systems
  ///     and compilers like GCC default to using UTF-32 when seeing a string like
  ///     L&quot;hello&quot;. You can force GCC to put UTF-16 in the 32 bit wide wchar_ts
  ///     (via -fwide-exec-charset=UTF-16) but then every other library accepting
  ///     &quot;wide strings&quot; will be confused by your UTF-16-inside-UTF-32-strings.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     So, to summarize: u8&quot;Hello&quot; works everywhere. L&quot;Hello&quot; works
  ///     for calls from Windows applications to Microsoft APIs but gives you a headache
  ///     in any other case, you don't even know if you'll get UTF-16 or UTF-32 until you
  ///     compile it.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     So use u8&quot;Hello&quot; everywhere. When interacting with Microsoft APIs,
  ///     translate via Utf16FromUtf8(). If you need &quot;wide strings&quot; (you shouldn't)
  ///     use WideCharFromUtf8() - it will select UTF-16 or UTF-32 to match wchar_t.
