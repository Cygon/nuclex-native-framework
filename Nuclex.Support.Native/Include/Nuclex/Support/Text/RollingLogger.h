  /// <summary>Logger that buffers lines cheaply in memory until they're needed</summary>
  /// <remarks>
  ///   <para>
  ///     This implementation of a logger is intended to be light on CPU time and constantly
  ///     collect log output in a circular buffer in the background. It will not cause
  ///     hard drive accesses and even avoids memory allocations if you avoid external string
  ///     formatting (i.e. you rely on Append() instead of std::format() or lexical_cast)
  ///     and keep you log lines below 100 characters.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     When an error happens, you can use the GetLines() method of the rolling logger to
  ///     obtain the last 1024 lines from the log's history and display this as technical
  ///     error information, save it to an error report file or upload it in a reporting tool.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <example>
  ///     <code>
  ///       logger.Inform(u8"Saving configuration {");
  ///       {
  ///         Logger::IndentationScope configurationLogScope(logger);
  ///
  ///         logger.Append(u8"ResolutionX = ");
  ///         logger.Append(1920);
  ///         logger.Inform(std::string());

  ///         logger.Append(u8"ResolutionY = ");
