  ///   <para>
  ///     This is a special variant of the <see cref="Nuclex.Support.Events.Event" /> class,
  ///     a very lean signal/slot implementation. Whereas the normal event attempts to achieve
  ///     maximum performance and minimum resource use in a single-threaded scenario,
  ///     the concurrent event attempts the same while allowing free-threaded use.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Like the single-threaded event, it is optimized towards granular use, meaning you
  ///     create many individual events rather than one big multi-purpose notification. It also
  ///     assumes that events typically have none or only a small number of subscribers and
  ///     is optimized for firing over subscription/unsubscription.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     This concurrent event implementation can be freely used from any thread, including
  ///     simultaneous firing, subscription and unsubscription without any synchronization on
  ///     the side of the user of the event. Firing uses a micro-spinlock around a piece of code
  ///     covering just a few CPU cyles (two instructions ideally), so waits are highly unlikely
  ///     and should be resolved in just a few cycles if they happen.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     A concurrent event should be equivalent in size to 3 pointers on its own.
  ///     It does not allocate any memory upon construction or firing, but will allocate
  ///     a memory block each time the number of subscribers passes a power of two.
  ///     Said memory block is the size of 4 pointers + two more pointers per subscriber.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>

  ///         public: int Dummy(int first, std::string second) { return 456; }
