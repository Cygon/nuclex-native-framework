  ///   <para>
  ///     When specifying an executable name without an absolute path, the directory
  ///     containing the running application will be searched first. This allows you to

  ///     shader compilers, updaters and launchers.

  ///     eventually fill the buffers of its stdout and stderr redirection pipes and
