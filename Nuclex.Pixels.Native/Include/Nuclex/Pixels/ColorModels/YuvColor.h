  ///   <para>
  ///     This format originated back in the black-and-white TV days, where first only
  ///     luminance (brightness) was transmitted and, to keep backwards compatibility,
  ///     chrominance (color) was latter added as a separate signal that encoded
  ///     U+V coordinates into a 2D color space.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     As it turned out, this format was also useful for digital signals because
  ///     the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than to color, so separating
  ///     luminance from chroma meant you could use lower-resolution chroma (i.e. only
  ///     store it for every second or fourth pixel and interpolate the ones inbetween.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     When made <em>digital</em> by quantizing, this format is called YCbCr (storing
  ///     Y, U and V as bytes either from 0..255 (&qout;full swing&quot;) or 16..235
  ///     (studio swing). However, this structure stores analogous values with U and V
  ///     components ranging from -1.0 .. +1.0, so this is actual YUV, not YCbCr.
  ///   </para>
